# Shopify
The Online Grocery Store Database project aims to establish a B2C application facilitating the seamless purchase of groceries for customers. The system encompasses various functionalities to enhance the shopping experience and ensure efficient management of products, orders, and customer interactions.

# Business Requirements
The platform provides users with the ability to create accounts, offering a personalized
experience with saved preferences and order history. The user signs up using his email
id, mobile number (unique) and created password. All orders are made using one
customer account so all user history is linked to this account. User profiles store
personal information, preferred delivery addresses, and order history. An order
management system ensures efficient tracking of order statuses, and customers can
view their complete order history.
A comprehensive product catalog is designed, featuring various categories and
subcategories. Each product includes detailed information such as name, brand,
description, images, prices, and unit measurements. Users can navigate through the
catalog using a search engine and apply filters based on categories, brands, prices, and
other relevant attributes.
The shopping cart functionality allows users to add and remove products from their
current order, providing a seamless and interactive shopping experience. During the
checkout process, customers can choose from multiple payment options, including cash
on delivery, credit/debit cards and digital wallets. Discounts and promo code are
integrated to enhance the shopping experience and encourage customer retention.
Users can apply promo codes during the checkout process. The platform incorporates a
sophisticated delivery management system, allowing users to choose delivery slots
based on availability. The user can place his order after the selection of the delivery
address from the list of saved addresses and order confirmation.
The system facilitates customer feedback through reviews and ratings for products,
creating a dynamic environment for customer interaction. A feedback system for overall
service and delivery is also implemented. A feedback mechanism allows customers to
provide suggestions and report issues, contributing to continuous improvement.
The tech support team updates the notifications database. Notifications keep users
informed about order confirmations, dispatch, and delivery status. Additionally,
promotional notifications based on user preferences are sent.
The platform enables grocery retailers to register by submitting their store details, which
are then verified through document verification by the tech support team. Once verified,
retailers gain access to the platform and can add their inventory details, including
product names, quantities, and prices, to start selling.
Retailers have the capability to manage their inventory, making updates and
adjustments as needed. Tech support team oversees the verification of inventory details
to ensure accuracy and consistency on the platform.
To maintain stock availability, the system introduces an order quantity threshold. If the
quantity of a product falls below this threshold, the item is temporarily unavailable for
ordering. Retailers can replenish stock by adding a batch of items, and once the
quantity exceeds the threshold, the product becomes available for ordering again.
Delivery executives can register on the portal by providing essential information,
including their name, phone number (unique), and official documents (such as Aadhar
card, driver's license, etc.). Additionally, they need to specify their mode of delivery,
whether it be a bike, cycle, or another mode. Upon successful registration, they start
receiving notifications for nearby delivery requests. These notifications prompt them to
either accept or deny the delivery request based on their availability and location. The
platform introduces statistical metrics linked to each delivery executive's account. These
statistics include average delivery time and average rating.
The customer support system is facilitated through a chat messaging system. The tech
support team shares messaging databases with customers, delivery executives and
retailers, allowing for three-way communication. This communication channel serves as
a means for customers to inquire about products, report issues with orders or delivery,
or seek assistance. Similarly, retailers can use it to address customer queries regarding
products received. Delivery executives can be inquired about delays in delivery and
missing products.
